# Growth Mindset
_Growth Mindset_ is the belief that one can actively develop and improve their abilities through effort, practice, and persistance. A _fixed mindset_ is the near oposite: the belief that one's abilities are stagnant and stay the same level despite putting in effort to improve them ([Haffenden 2015](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset)).
Having a growth mindset will help me continue to improve my learning and cognition through my work and daily tasks. To continue to have a growth mindset, I will remind myself the following:
 - [x]  __Observe__ what I see are obstacles and find differnt solutions to push through my progress
 - [x] __*Physicaly* write down__ and explain my daily tasks & objectives. Doing this will clearly state what is asked of me and what I need to finish each day
 - [x] __Understand__ that I may not always have the answers and that asking for help is valid and helpful to my work and my mindset.
