# Git Clone Exercise

Now that the terminal is becoming more and more familiar to me, cloning my repo and learning how to markup files and commit them via terminal is much less daunting than I anticipated. After refreshing and checking my repo with `git status`, I learned the 3 important steps for pushing a file into my repository: Add, Change, Publish

`git add` allows me to add the new changes to my files in order for me to save and commit them

`git commit -m 'add &/or update...'` is what I see as my "Save As..." button. This titles my file changes and adds a description of why such changes we made to said file

`git push` does what it says. After inserting `git status` into the terminal, a message lets me know that I am ready to save and publish my updated file back into the repository live and ready to be executed.
