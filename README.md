# Matt's Reading Notes for Code 102
## About Me
Hi, I'm Matt Scieszinski! I'm a 2019 graduate of Xavier High School. I'm currently a food delivery driver and marketer for Chomp Delivery. I'm here because I wanted to work full time as well as find myself a trade before committing to a college education. DeltaV was recommended to me by the news and family members. After taking the 101 course, I knew this fit my career path. Fun Fact: I own and am currently learning to play an autoharp, an uncommon folk/bluegrass instrument! I also volunteer my time transcribing music on Genius.
