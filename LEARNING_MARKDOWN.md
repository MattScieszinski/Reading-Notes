# What's Markdown?
GitHub uses markdown, (.md) files that contain lightweight markup text used to code files in our repositories. This allows your text to be displayed on the main page of your repository. 

Like README.md, these files hold information and are used commonly in title pages and site navigation towards other markdown files in the site. Markdown is similar to HTML (HyperText Markup Language) in that they control the appearance of text in a file. Markdown uses syntax, whereas HTML uses its tags.

Editing a file is differnt from Google Docs or Word: _Google Docs_ and _Word_ are WYSIWYG, What you see is what you get, the text entered into the file is how it directly appears in the file. Markdown's syntax allows you to manually edit the text's format and appearance, giving you more precision into your work.

### Syntax 
( _  or * ) _Italicizes your text_

(__ or ** ) **Bolds your text**
  
*These syntax can be __nested__ inside of eachother*

___OR put together___
