# What's Markdown
GitHub uses markdown, (.md) files that contain lightweight markup text used to code files in our repositories. This allows your text to be displayed on the main page of your repository. Like README.md, these files hold information and are used commonly in title pages and site navigation towards other markdown files in the site. Markdown is similar to HTML (HyperText Markup Language) in that they control the appearance of text in a file. Markdown uses syntax, whereas HTML uses its tags.
