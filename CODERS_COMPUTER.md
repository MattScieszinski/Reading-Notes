## Text Editors and Instalations
When starting to create a webstie to write and run code, the important tool to have is your _text editor_. _Text Editors_ (E.g. TextEdit, Visual Studio Code, Brackets, Notepad++) are going to be the main program(s) that you will allow you to format and create websites to connect to servers and become viewable via internet.

When looking for a quality text editor to use, the program you use should have the following:
+ __Code Complexion__
  + Displays possible suggestions and tags as you type (I.e. "an Autofill option")
+ __Syntax Highlighting__
  + Highlights different tags as seperate colors for optimal reading and identification
+ __Themes__
  + Allows text and background colors to be customized
+ __Extensions__
  + Downloadable content that can enhance your user experience
  
To make sure my terminal, text editor, and code all operate, I installed some programs to make them all connect and run
- Homebrew: A software package that simplifies installations on Mac OS
- Git: [Git](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjI7fuEzeLqAhVPbc0KHWQiDNEQmhMwGnoECAwQAg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FGit&usg=AOvVaw0mR6q4LmK3M4ft3iKkMUI3) is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files
- Node & NPM: Node.js allows Javascript to be run on my software and NPM is the Node Package Manager for the Javascript language
- ESLint: Examines and identifies patterns and problems in Javasript
- Tree: Lists directories in a tree format

  
## The Terminal 
Here are some important commands to get started with

`pwd` : _Print Working Directory_

`cd` : _Change Directory_

`ls` : _LiSt_

`echo` will **echo** messages back into the terminal

`.` Applies to hidden files. `ls -a` Will list all items in a directory _including the hidden files that start with "."_


Text files end in `.txt` , executable files end in `.exe` , &  image files end in `.img .png .gif`


`~` Returns you back to the home directory,
`.` is your current directory, &
`..` puts you in the parent directory.
