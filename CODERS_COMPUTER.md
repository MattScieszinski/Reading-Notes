## Text Editors
When starting to create a webstie to write and run code, the important tool to have is your _text editor_. _Text Editors_ (E.g. TextEdit, Visual Studio Code, Brackets, Notepad++) are going to be the main program(s) that you will allow you to format and create websites to connect to servers and become viewable via internet.

When looking for a quality text editor to use, the program you use should have the following:
+ __Code Complexion__
  + Displays possible suggestions and tags as you type (I.e. "an Autofill option")
+ __Syntax Highlighting__
  + Highlights different tags as seperate colors for optimal reading and identification
+ __Themes__
  + Allows text and background colors to be customized
+ __Extensions__
  + Downloadable content that can enhance your user experience
  
## The Terminal 
Here are some important commands to get started with

`pwd` : _Print Working Directory_

`cd` : _Change Directory_

`ls` : _LiSt_

`echo` will **echo** messages back into the terminal

`.` applies to hidden files. `ls -a` will list all items in a directory _including the hidden files that start with "."_

text files end in `.txt` , executable files end in `.exe` , &  image files end in `.img .png .gif`
