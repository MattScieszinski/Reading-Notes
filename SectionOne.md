# Mindsets and Learning

## Path vs. Sandbox
_Path learning_ take the student along a pth to reach the goal of a class or lesson. Learning become linear as information is transfered through exmples with predictable outcomes and easy-to-grasp, listed concepts. The end goal is a __transfer of knowledge__ to the student.
  _Sandbox Learning_ always creativity and individuality of the student to reach the class/ lesson goal freely through their own trial and error. With little structure and guidlines, students can practice and devleop their skills through their work and creations. At the end, the goal is learned by __intertwining ideas and creativity__ throughout the students work.
