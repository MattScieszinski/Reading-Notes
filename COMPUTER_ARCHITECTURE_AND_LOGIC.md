# Computer Architecture & Logic

Explained in the [How Computers Work](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNcsRwJhvksEo1tJqjIqWbN-) playlist by [Code.org](https://code.org), I learned about how the hardware, software, the Central Processing Unit, and Operating Systems all work cohesively to run as the modern computers I work with today.

Since the birth of computers, every computer has the same 4 attributes. Computers: 
+ A.) __Input__ information. It takes in a physical stimulus and takes that information into the computer's memory.
+ B.) __Store__ information. The input for a computer is converted into _Binary Code_ (code that only uses 1's and 0's) and stores it into the computer's memory to be used.
+ C.) __Process__ information. Stored information is then manipulated through a series of commands called an _Algorithm_ and sent out.
+ D.) __Output__ information. With the newly processed information, the information is sent out as a physical, interactive response, beit images, sound, texts, or in some cases, a wifi signal. 

This process happens rapidly and even loop with other computers. One computer's input is another's output.

Computers use the Binary Code system to run the entire computer, making it a key component of how a computer operates. Virtually no one works on computer's binary, therefore the wires and circuts are the hardware that complete that job for us. Wires operate by turning ON and OFF, inputing a 1 and a 0 value respectively. 1 _Bit_ is the amount of 1 wire in its ON/OFF state. These are the smallest pieces of information the computer stores. With more wires, comes more bits, leading to more storage of more complex pieces of information. Wires are the backbone of the computer

A computer's _Circuts_ modify, manipulate, and combine input signals from the wires they're connected to. With the vast amount of circuts, wires can connect interchagablly to different circuts to perform complex calculations. From the beginning of computers, humans have improved circuts from the once large 8-bit circuts the size of refrigerators, to now microscopic chips, allowing computers to be smaller in size and have a faster processing power. Because of the smaller circuts, wires have shorter distances to travel making them almost as fast as the speed of light.

To refresh, Input takes a physical stimulus and turns it into binary & Output takes binary and turns it into a physical stimulus. For even the simplest of outputs, the computers memory has stored over 1000's of algorithms to process input to return as an output. From the moment there is a stimulus, a computer immediately processes the given infomation into a response.

Here are some important vocabulary to identify the major parts of a computers: 
+ __Hardware__: The numerous physical parts of a computer like wires, circuts, chips, and plugs.
+ __Software__: The programming languages that run the machine like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. These progamming languages utilize and simplify the binary to be interpreted and perform on the computer.
+ __Central Processing Unit (CPU)__: The master chip that all the hardware feeds from. Inside the CPU are smaller parts that perform specific tasks for the computer, like math, logic, inputs, and outputs.
+ __Operating System (OS)__: The master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer. It decides what is downloaded into memory, run, and processed, one input at a time.
